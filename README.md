### My Story

A while ago, I started my own fitness journey and took the steps towards improving my well-being. However, like many, it took me a while to get serious and perfect my form and become stronger. Going through hours of fitness resources and apps helped me to reach my goals and to get acquainted with a soon-to-be passion of mine.

Over months, I started to realize that looking up exercises was very tedious and often led to me having to watch long videos for something that could be explained in a few seconds. Furthermore, I had no way of logging my progress and seeing my changes over time. This led to the inspiration behind GymBro.

I hope that GymBro can be of use to you in reaching your health goals and becoming a better version of you!
